    <string name="minesweeper_desc">In Minesweeper, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: uncovered, covered and flagged. A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location.\n\nIf a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game. Otherwise, the uncovered cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (\'\'-\'\'), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. In flag-mode, clicking on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells are still considered covered, and a player can click on them to uncover them, although they must first be unflagged with an additional flag-mode click. You can switch between normal and flag-mode by clicking the button with spade/flag icon.</string>
